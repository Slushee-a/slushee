Powershell script that creates a shortcut from a program I made to the shell:startup folder.
This is here for a BadUSB to copy. BadUSBs are based on that the computer is configured for an english keyboard input, but I'm in Spain so I have to replace every special character
with a keystroke that contains a code from the USB HID usage tables. Instead of spending hours on end translatind the script to keytsrokes, I made this page so the BadUSB copies
the script from it.
